The raytracer is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path
of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters
with virtual objects.

In this project, we handle 3 kind of objects: sphere, plane, triangle.
You can add object in the input file in the correct format to see them
in the program.
You can also add light to make effect on the object. you must specify the
kind of light and the good parameter to see the result.

The program create an .PPM output file that you can open with an image
viewer to see the result.
